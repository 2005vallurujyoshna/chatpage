This code creates a simple, styled chat page using HTML and CSS, simulating a chat interface with two types of chat bubbles: one for user messages and another for the chat partnerâ€™s messages.

Background: The page has a background image applied to the <body>, giving a chat-like ambiance.
Chat Container: The main chat box (.chat-container) has a dark background color, rounded corners, padding, and a centered header reading "Chat Room."
Chat Header: The header at the top is styled with a larger font to represent the chat room title.
Chat Messages: Each message bubble (.chat-message) is styled with padding, rounded corners, and different background colors based on whether it's a "user" or "partner" message. User messages align to the right, while partner messages align to the left, simulating a real chat flow.
